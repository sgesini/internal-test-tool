# internal-test-tool

The goal of this tool is to run a testing tool on Payplug's API. 
The tool is based on the following documentation : https://developer.dalenys.com/ui/developer-doc/getting-started.html

On its current state, the tool is only using the sandbox environment of Payplug. There is no plan to develop any production environment in this tool. 

How to use : 
Requirements :
-Any framework allowing to run a server
-Sandbox account to implement within the environments tab

After running your servers, you will find all of the integration types of Payplug's API. Your sandbox account credentials are only stored locally within your browser, there is no server side registration. 
Please check the documentation here if you need to understand how to setup the parameters : https://developer.dalenys.com/ui/developer-doc/parameter-reference.html
